/**
 * @brief Basic memory object/file abstraction.
 * 
 * The dataResource base class can be fully constructed and will load a
 * complete file into RAM. When calling either openFile() or saveFile()
 * using a wide character string, the function merely converts the wide string
 * into a multi-byte character string, then delegates the rest of the file
 * operation to the c-string openFile/closeFile methods. This means that if
 * this class is derived from, there is little need to overload the wide-string
 * methods.
